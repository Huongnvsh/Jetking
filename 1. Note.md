## Login
 In both cases of run level 3 or 5 you need to provide username and password. Bash uses the following initialization and start-up files:

1.  [/etc/profile] - The systemwide initialization file, executed for login shells.
2.  [/etc/bash.bashrc]- The systemwide per-interactive-shell startup file. This is a non-standard file which may not exist on your distribution. Even if it exists, it will not be sourced unless it is done explicitly in another start-up file.
3.  [/etc/bash.logout]- The systemwide login shell cleanup file, executed when a login shell exits.
4.  $HOME/[.bash_profile] - The personal initialization file, executed for login shells.
5.  $HOME/[.bashrc]- The individual per-interactive-shell startup file.
6.  $HOME/[.bash_logout)  - The individual login shell cleanup file, executed when a login shell exits.
7.  $HOME/[.inputrc - Individual


## Shell 

-  You can check a list vail login shell from file `/etc/sheels`
```
nguyenhungsync@compute:~$ cat /etc/shells
# /etc/shells: valid login shells
/bin/sh
/bin/dash
/bin/bash
/bin/rbash
/usr/bin/screen
```

- Which command also help you display full path of  command
```
which command
```

- Shell defined 3 types of shell : alias, external, internet . `Type` command help you check what type of command
```
type command
```

- To run a script , you must attach excutable permission 
```
chmod +x script.sh
```

- At the begin of shell file, we have a syntax which `#!` decide what interpreter for execution under system
- You can use *HERE Document* to create multiline  comment
```
<<EOF
12321
test
3123r
EOF
```


## System variable

- Linux create and matain a number of variable itself. This type of variable is defined CAPITAL LETTERS , like : PATH, HOME , USER
- To view all variable under system, u can use some of command
```
set 
type set
env
print

```

- To display variable , u can use command `echo` with begin `$` sysbol ,should be enclosed in quotes `""` or "{}"
```
echo "$HOME"
echo "${USER}"
```

- To display ouput of shell command, use can use commands list bellow
```
echo $(date)
echo `date	`
```

- U can set a variable with its value in `{}`
```
echo ${data=yes}
```

- Do not push space when asign variable and its value
 
 - Note about quote
![](https://i.imgur.com/UQHerGb.png)

- You can use the backslash (\) as last character on line to continue command on next line
- To make the variable known to child processes, use the export command. Try the following example at a console or terminal
- By default all user defined variables are local. They are not exported to new processes. Use export command to export variables and functions to child processes. If no variable names or function names are given, or if the -p option is given, a list of all names that are exported in this shell is printed. An argument of -n says to remove the export property from subsequent NAMEs.
- Use unset command to delete the variables during program execution. It can remove both functions and shell variables.

- Read input from keyboard
```
#!/bin/bash
read -p "Enter your name : " name
echo "Hi, $name. Let us be friends!"
```
	The -s option causes input coming from a terminal do not be displayed on the screen. This is useful for password handling (readpass.sh):
```
#!/bin/bash
read -s -p "Enter Password  : " my_password
echo 
echo "Your password - $my_password"
```


- Arithmetic expansion and evaluation is done by placing an integer expression using the following format:
```
$((expression))
$(( n1+n2 ))
$(( n1/n2 ))
$(( n1-n2 ))
```

- To create an integer variable use the  ("Declare command")  as follows:

declare -i y=10
echo $y 

- To repeat last command Just type !! at a shell prompt:
```
!!

```

- To repeat a command by its number .Recall to command line number 13:
```
history
!13
```

-   A curly braces ({..}) expands to create pattern and syntax is:
```
{pattern1,pattern2,patternN }
text { pattern1,pattern2,patternN}
command something/{ pattern1, pattern2, patternN }
```

- To ignore an alias called ls and run ls command
```
\ls
```

- If PROMPT_COMMAND environment variable set, the value is executed as a command prior to issuing each primary prompt. In other words, the contents of this variable are executed as a regular Bash command just before Bash displays a prompt
```
PROMPT_COMMAND="echo Yahooo"
```

- A condition is mainly a comparison between two values. Open a shell prompt (console) and type the following command:
	- We can test `echo $(( 5 < 2 ))`
	- Answer is zero (0). Shell simple compared two number and returned result as true or false. Is 5 is less than 2? No. So 0 is returned. The Boolean (logical data) type is a primitive data type having one of two values
	- ![](https://i.imgur.com/e9QhxwD.png)

- test condition
```
test condition && true-command
```
- U can use pari `&&` to defined command output true or flase . If use `&&` , command 2 only excute when ouput command 1 that true
```
test 5 -gt 2 && echo "Yes"
test 1 -lt 2 && echo "Yes"
```
- You need to use the test command while making decisions. Try the following examples and note down its output:
```
test 5 -eq 5 && echo Yes || echo No
test 5 -eq 15 && echo Yes || echo No
``` 
 If use `||` , command 2 only return if command 1 has ouput that false

```
read -p "Enter a password" pass
if test "$pass" == "jerry"
then
     echo "Password verified."
fi
```

```
##!/bin/bash
read -p "Enter a password" pass
if test "$pass" = "jerry"
then
     echo "Password verified."
else
     echo "Access denied."	
fi
```

## Exit Status

-   Every Linux command executed by the shell script or user, has an exit status.
-   The exit status is an integer number.
-   The Linux man pages stats the exit statuses of each command.
-   0 exit status means the command was successful without any errors.
-   A non-zero (1-255 values) exit status means command was failure.
-   You can use special shell variable called  **$?**  to get the exit status of the previously executed command. To print  **$?**  variable use the  "Echo command":

# Conditional execution

1.  [Logical AND && "Logical AND")  - Run second command only if  **first is successful**.
2.  [Logical OR ||]"Logical OR")  - Run second command only if first is  **not successful**.

```
test $(id -u) -eq 0  && echo "You are root" || echo "You are NOT root"
[ condition ] && true-command
[ condition ] && true-command || false-command
```
- https://bash.cyberciti.biz/guide/Numeric_comparison

# Logical Not !
```
[ ! expression ]
! expression
if [ ! condition ]
then
     command1
     command2
fi
test ! -f /etc/resolv.conf && echo "File /etc/resolv.conf not found."
test ! -f /etc/resolv.conf && echo "File /etc/resolv.conf not found." || echo "File /etc/resolv.conf found."
[ ! -f $HOME/.config ] && { echo "Error: $HOME/.config file not found."; exit 1; }
```

- Backup DB
```
#!/bin/bash
# A sample shell script to backup MySQL database

# Get todays date
NOW=$(date +"%d-%m-%Y")

# Location to store mysql backup
BAK="/nas10/.mysql-database"

# MySQL Server Login Information
MUSER="root"			#### mysql user name ###
MPASS="YOUR-PASSWORD-HERE"	#### mysql password  ###
MHOST="127.0.0.1"		#### mysql host name ###

# Full path to common utilities
MYSQL="/usr/bin/mysql"
MYSQLDUMP="/usr/bin/mysqldump"
GZIP="/bin/gzip"

# If backup directory does not exits create it using logical not
if [ ! -d "$BAK" ]
then
  mkdir -p "$BAK"
fi

# Get all mysql databases names
DBS="$($MYSQL -u $MUSER -h $MHOST -p$MPASS -Bse 'show databases')"

# Start backup
echo -n "Dumping..."

# Use the for loop
for db in $DBS
do
 FILE="$BAK/mysql-$db.$NOW-$(date +"%T").gz"
  $MYSQLDUMP -u $MUSER -h $MHOST -p$MPASS $db | $GZIP -9 > $FILE
 echo -n "."
done
echo -n  "...Done"
echo ""
```

-All command line parameters ( positional parameters ) are available via special shell variable $1, $2, $3,...,$9.

# A Note About $@ and $*
- `$@` expands to the positional parameters, starting from one. When the expansion occurs within double quotes, each parameter expands to a separate word. That is, "$@" is equivalent to "$1" "$2" .. "$n". If the double-quoted expansion occurs within a word, the expansion of the first parameter is joined with the beginning part of the original word, and the expansion of the last parameter is joined with the beginning part of the original word, and the expansion of the last parameter is joined with the last part of the original word. When there are no positional parameters, "$@" and $@ expand to nothing (i.e., they are removed).
-   ` $*` expanded as "$1y$2y$3y...$n", where y is the value of  $IFS  variable i.e. "$*" is one long string and $IFS act as an separator or token delimiters.


# $ Variable
- Bash shell set several special parameters. For example $? (see return values section) holds the return value of the executed command.

	- All command line parameters or arguments can be accessed via $1, $2, $3,..., $9.
	- `$*` holds all command line parameters or arguments.
	- `$#` holds the number of positional parameters.
	- `$-` holds flags supplied to the shell.
	- `$?` holds the return value set by the previously executed command.
	- `$$` holds the process number of the shell (current shell).
	- `$!` hold the process number of the last background command.
	- `$@` holds all command line parameters or arguments.

#  Exit command

 - `exit N`

- The exit statement is used to exit from the shell script with a status of N.

- Use the exit statement to indicate successful or unsuccessful shell script termination.

- The value of N can be used by other commands or shell scripts to take their own action.

- If N is omitted, the exit status is that of the last command executed.

- Use the exit statement to terminate shell script upon an error.

- If N is set to 0 means normal shell exit. Create a shell script called exitcmd.sh:

# Dev Null

- All data written on a /dev/null or /dev/zero special file is discarded by the system. Use /dev/null to send any unwanted output from program/command and syntax is:
```

# Sub Shell

-   Whenever you run a shell script, it creates a new process called subshell and your script will get executed using a subshell.
-   A Subshell can be used to do parallel processing.
-   If you start another shell on top of your current shell, it can be referred to as a subshell. Type the following command to see subshell value:
